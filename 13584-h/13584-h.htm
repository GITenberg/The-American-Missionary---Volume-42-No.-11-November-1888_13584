    <h3>NOT QUITE FREE.</h3>
    <p>In the November MISSIONARY of last year, the financial statement bore the simple
    and joyous heading "FREE." This year we are compelled to prefix two qualifying words.
    Our books closed September 30, with a balance of $5,641.21 on the wrong side. While
    we regret that there should be any debt, we rejoice that it is no larger.</p>
    <p>The receipts applicable to current expenses fell off somewhat during the year,
    while the expenditures, owing to general growth and some special demands were greater
    than last year. The first of September, therefore, found us confronting an impending
    debt. The appeal which we felt constrained to make for September, and which was made
    under some special disadvantages as compared with last year, was met with so hearty a
    response in gifts and in expressions of interest in our work, as to move us to
    gratitude to God and thankfulness to our friends. A few of the donors gave $1,000
    each, but the larger share of the responses contained remittances of less than $100.
    Many of the sums were quite small, and some of them indicated great self-sacrifice on
    the part of the donors. A few brief extracts, all that our limited space will allow,
    from a small portion of the letters received, will be found below.</p>
    <p>We thank God and take courage. We believe that our friends who remembered us in
    the past will not forget us in the future, and that our wants in October, and in all
    the following months, will not be forgotten because they were so well remembered in
    September. One thousand dollars a day represents our needs for carrying on the work
    in its present development.</p>
    <h4><i>Encouraging Responses to our Appeal.</i></h4>
    <p>"I would like to send you more, but I send you the last dollar I have ($71.00,)
    and must trust the Lord for means to support us until my next <a name="page298"
    id="page298"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 298]</span> month's payment, and for means
    to go to the meeting of the A.B.C.F.M., in case I attend."</p>
    <p>"Twenty-five cents of this money was from a woman 82 years old. She is almost
    helpless. The family in which she lives is very poor. She has not a penny that she
    calls her own. She said to me, 'Here is the widow's mite. I prayed that the Lord
    would send me something to give away. You please take it and send it where it will do
    the most good.' I send it to you trusting that with her prayers of faith, it may be
    useful."</p>
    <p>The writer of a letter enclosing a donation of $10 adds in a postscript in regard
    to the donor: "Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; was born May 5th, 1787, and is an <i>old
    contributor</i>."</p>
    <p>"I have expended all my appropriation for charitable purposes this present year,
    yet I can, perhaps, curtail in some directions and so remit to you $20 as a small
    tributary to swell the stream for meeting indebtedness. I hope your appeal will
    accomplish the results desired.</p>
    <p>"Through abounding grace, my wife and I are once more permitted the joyful
    privilege of sending for the general work of the American Missionary Association,
    $100 enclosed herewith in draft to your order. (Their third contribution this year.
    Ed.) Say to the dear brethren in the work of the Master: 'Be of good courage, fear
    not, for I am with you'; <i>His</i> own words enduring forever."</p>
    <p>"Enclosed, please find check for $100. I am always glad to be remembered on
    special appeals when they are necessary, even if I cannot help. I do not know that I
    enjoy anything more than what I am able to give to the A.M.A. I trust your appeal
    will find many generous responses."</p>
    <p>"Your kind and thoughtful letter of the 13th, received. It affords me real
    pleasure to respond to your call for our Association. The good Lord has more or less
    blessed me with opportunity and ability to acquire money, and may He forbid that I
    should turn his blessings into curses by hoarding the gifts of his providence, when
    the cry of the poor and down-trodden is heard. I enclose my check for $100 for the
    cause."</p>
    <p>"It is a small contribution, but it comes from a small church. Certainly it
    represents a genuine interest in the work of your society and is accompanied with
    prayers for its success."</p>
    <p>An executor, in remitting a legacy of $500 says: "It is not due according to the
    terms of the will till next spring, but you may find it useful at this time to help
    out the year."</p>
    <p>We have received from Oaks, North Carolina, towards the extinguishment of our
    debt, a contribution from forty-nine different persons, amounting to $5.66. This
    represents a degree of sacrifice, not surpassed, perhaps, by<a name="page299"
    id="page299"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 299]</span> any who have contributed.
    Seventy cents of it were in cash; sixty-six cents were value in fodder; one dollar
    and thirty-four cents in potatoes and corn; one dollar and one cent in work.</p>
    <p>The missionary who is ministering to these very poor people says: "If all who love
    the A.M.A. would do as well, according to their ability, your treasury would be
    filled."</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>THE MOHONK CONFERENCE.</h3>
    <p>This Conference is unique in its character, and in the place where it is held.
    Lake Mohonk was born in a great earthquake that sunk it in its solid rocky bed, and
    piled up around it wonderful ranges of hills and vast splintered rocks. The splendid
    summer resort built on the margin of the Lake is the work of Mr. A.K. Smiley, a man
    of creative genius, and of kind manners and a warm heart. The house, or rather the
    range of houses, is picturesque, and the walks among the hills and down the rocky
    gorges, and the forty miles of excellent roads, give the widest scope for walking and
    driving.</p>
    <p>The Conference is the invention of Mr. Smiley. To it, he invites annually a
    hundred or more guests, giving them the freedom of the house; and three days are
    spent in the discussion of Indian affairs, interspersed with afternoon drives amid
    the striking scenery. The invitation is extended to those who are supposed to be
    intelligently interested in the Indians; but within that limit there is the freest
    range&mdash;men and women of all political parties and of all religious denominations
    being included. The acts of the Conference, like the utterances of a Congregational
    Council, have only the authority of the reason that is in them; yet it is wonderful
    what an influence this peculiar body has had on public sentiment. Its utterances have
    been discussed and have had their weight in the pulpit, the press, in Congress and in
    the White House. The Indian and the Nation owe much to the Mohonk Conference.</p>
    <p>The Sixth Annual Conference, which closed September 28th, sustained the interest
    of past years in the importance of the topics discussed, in the divergency of opinion
    at first, and in the complete harmony at the end. The points agreed upon in the
    platform were arranged under five heads. The first relates to the establishment of
    Courts of Justice in the Reservations and accessible to the Indians; the second to
    the important need of education, demanding that the Government shall undertake at
    once the entire task of providing primary and secular education for all Indian
    children; the third urges that this education shall be compulsory, under proper
    limitations; the fourth emphasizes the duty of the churches to furnish religious
    instruction to the Indians, and the immunity of their work from all governmental
    interference where sustained wholly by missionary funds; the fifth approves of the
    co-operation of the Government with the missionary<a name="page300"
    id="page300"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 300]</span> societies in contract schools
    during the present transitional condition of the Indians. We append the last two
    items of the report.</p>
    <blockquote><p>4. In view of the great work which the Christian Churches have done
    in the past in inaugurating and maintaining schools among the Indians, and of the
    essential importance of religious as distinguished from secular education, for their
    civil, political and moral well-being, an element of education which, in the nature
    of the case, the National Government cannot afford, the churches should be allowed the
    largest liberty, not, indeed, to take away the responsibility from the Government in
    its legitimate sphere of educational work, but to supplement it to the fullest extent
    in their power, by such schools, whether primary, normal or theological, as are at
    the sole cost of the benevolent or missionary societies. And it is the deliberate
    judgment of this Conference that in the crisis of the Indian transitional movement
    the churches should arouse themselves to the magnitude and emergency of the duty thus
    laid upon them in the providence of God.</p>
    <p>5. Nothing should be done to impair or weaken the agencies at present engaged in
    the work of Indian education. Every such agency should be encouraged and promoted,
    except as other and better agencies are provided for the work. In particular, owing
    to the anomalous condition of the Indians and the fact that the Government is
    administering trust funds that belong to them, what is known as the "contract
    system"&mdash;by which the nation aids by appropriations private and missionary
    societies in the work of Indian education&mdash;ought to be maintained by a
    continuance of such aid, until the Government is prepared, with adequate buildings
    and competent teachers, to assume the entire work of secular education. In no case
    should the Government establish schools to compete with private or church schools
    which are already doing a good work, so long as there are thousands of Indian
    children for whose education no provision is made.</p></blockquote>

    <h3>ORDINATION AT NEW ORLEANS.</h3>
    <p>A council of Congregational Churches was held in New Orleans, Sept. 16th, for the
    purpose of ordaining Prof. Geo. W. Henderson, A.M., B.D., to the Christian ministry.
    Rev. R.C. Hitchcock, President of Straight University, was chosen Moderator. Mr.
    Henderson sustained an excellent examination, and was installed Pastor of the Central
    Congregational Church. The entire service was impressive, and Rev. Mr. Henderson
    enters upon a very responsible charge of a large church with many encouragements and

    <h3>OUR SCHOOLS AND THE YELLOW FEVER.</h3>
    <p>We have been extremely gratified with the manifestations of faith and courage on
    the part of our lady teachers in the South during the time of fear and panic because
    of the yellow fever. Some were already at their stations and in their schools, and
    some were on the way, subject to the trials of quarantine. Not one hesitated in the
    path of duty. Many teachers from the different parts of the North were ready to go
    when the reports of the pestilence were most alarming, but not one of the teachers
    who had previously been in <a name="page301" id="page301"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 301]</span> the work, failed to await instructions to go forward
    whenever we should speak the word. We have been grateful to God during all these days
    of the autumn for the splendid qualities of consecration and courage which have come
    out of our correspondence with our honored teachers. Never did their fathers or
    brothers, years ago, when deadly war called them to face the perils of battle, show
    higher courage or a larger sense of duty. Almost all of our Southern schools are now
    in session, and begin with increased attendance.</p>
    <p>SCHOOL ECHO.&mdash;A teacher writes: "One of my pupils who had been teaching
    during the summer came to me in despair over a sum, saying: "I can't understand
    <i>sympathizing fractions</i>."</p>
    <p>(When we went to school years and years ago, "sympathizing fractions," meant
    broken candy. We understood, but the teacher didn't. Times change, and we change with
    them.)</p>

    <h3>THE SAMARITAN WOMAN.</h3>
    <center>
      BY REV. C.J. RYDER, BOSTON.
    </center>
    <blockquote>
      "And they marveled that he talked with the woman."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Why? She was a sinful woman. But these disciples must even thus early in Christ's
    ministry have learned that he had come to call sinners, not the righteous, to
    repentance. She was a Samaritan! That was a larger reason for their marvel. They
    could rise above their hatred for sin more easily than their race prejudice; so can
    we. The Samaritans were an inferior people. Degraded they were. They had been
    degraded for centuries. The Jews shunned them. Socially our Lord was making a great
    blunder, perhaps a fatal blunder, in talking to this Samaritan woman. His cause was
    in its infancy. The hand of social prejudice would surely throttle it. Why antagonize
    the existing order of society? How much better to utilize it for the establishment
    and enlargement of the great and glorious kingdom of our Lord! This cause needed the
    influence of Jewish leaders. Why risk this potent influence for the sake of one
    miserable Samaritan woman, or, for that matter, for a whole race of Samaritans? It
    seemed very poor management of a cause, new in that country. "Far be such unwisdom
    from thee, Lord," we can hear the impassioned and worldly-wise Peter exclaim. But our
    Lord chose to sacrifice the temporary success of his kingdom that he might be true to
    the eternal principles of that kingdom; and so he talked with this sinful woman of
    this despised race just as considerately as with Nicodemus. He invited her to his
    discipleship just as cordially, and to the same discipleship. There is not a hint
    that the Good Shepherd built another fold for the Samaritan sheep, lest some of the
    Jewish flock should jump over the fence, if they were put into the same fold.</p>
    <p><a name="page302" id="page302"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 302]</span> These
    Samaritans were not only degraded and despised socially, but they were also
    superstitious in their religious beliefs, and semi-heathen in their forms of worship.
    It would take generations to bring them up to a level with the Jewish Christians.
    They could not comprehend much of the intelligent preaching that Christ addressed to
    the Jews. Why not appoint a special missionary for them, and then quietly exclude
    them from the ordinary gatherings? This course would avoid criticism; it would not
    violate the established ideas of social and religious propriety. Nothing need be said
    about it. It would not be best to put it on parchment; just let it be quietly
    whispered about that the disciples thought it was better for the Samaritan Christians
    not to meet with the others. The disciples were surrounded by prejudiced people, to
    be sure, but these prejudices were very old; time would correct all these social and
    race inequalities. The disciples thought it better to ignore them, and just organize
    and carry on their work with no reference to these degraded and superstitious
    Samaritans. Such seems to have been somewhat the reasoning of these timid disciples.
    It was not our Lord's reasoning; the doors of his blessed kingdom opened to all. It
    required no magic sesame of race respectability to throw back these gates of pardon
    and hope. Sin must be left outside, but the sinner of every race and tribe was
    welcomed to all the privileges of this kingdom. We now see the wisdom and the
    divinity of our Lord's course.</p>
    <p>Had these marveling disciples had their way, the sect of the Christians would have
    been added to the sects of the Herodians and the Sadducees, and been buried in the
    same grave centuries ago. The voice that talked with this Samaritan woman is heard
    round the globe now, and every century only adds greater authority to its divine
    utterance; and it is heard because it spoke with this despised Samaritan woman. Our
    Lord did not ignore this race prejudice; he rebuked it. And so these timid disciples,
    realizing only the temporary danger that threatened, marveled that he talked with
    this woman. God pity them! But how human they were. So to-day, in India, the
    missionaries of the cross, true to their Lord's great example, talk with pariah and
    Brahmin, and welcome them both to equal privileges in the kingdom of his
    grace&mdash;and men marvel. And so in Alabama and South Carolina, the missionaries of
    the cross, true to the same divine example, talk with black and with white, and
    welcome them both to the same privileges in this kingdom&mdash;and even some timid
    disciples marvel. But the principles of this divine kingdom do not change; the Lord
    of that kingdom, who talked with the sinful, weary, despised Samaritan woman, would,
    if here in bodily presence now, talk with the sinful, weary, despised black woman, no
    matter how much his worldly-wise disciples might marvel. His kingdom is built upon
    this eternal truth of human brotherhood, and it will endure because it is. Nothing
    short of this is of his kingdom, but will crumble to dust.</p>

    <h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Forty-Second Annual Report Of The Executive
    Committee,</h2>
    <center>
      FOR THE YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30TH, 1888.
    </center>
    <hr class="short" />
    <h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">General Survey.</h3>
    <hr class="short" />
    <p>The field of missions is the world which lieth in darkness. We have to do with
    that part of it for which we are doubly responsible. It is in darkness and it is our
    own.</p>
    <p>We look upon our own land, with its States equal in extent and capacity to foreign
    kingdoms. When we know that they hold the certainty of a future influence of which
    their past power has been but a prophecy, our fears press hard upon our hopes.</p>
    <p>Nor are our work and our fears an intrusion. When the pestilence which walks in
    darkness brings the destruction which wastes at noonday, it is our call to feel
    deeply the distresses of those who are stricken. But plagues consuming human lives
    are less grevious than those which abide, and which, walking in the intellectual and
    moral darkness of a people, waste the lives of men and the hopes of souls. This is
    our call.</p>
    <p>Remember that it is our own country where, in twelve great States, like empires,
    forty per cent. of the population cannot read, where, to-day, three-fourths of the
    illiteracy of the whole nation exists; where the darkness is increasing more rapidly
    than it is being lighted up; where much which passes for religion even among those
    who preach it, is a travesty upon Christianity, openly divorced from relationship
    with truth, purity, integrity and intelligence.</p>
    <p>Our survey takes in questions that are painful; disturbing questions that are not
    in the North, nor in the West. They are difficult to meet. They are near, and the
    troubles which the questions hold are near. They come close to the heart of
    Christianity. They are close to the life of the churches. They are close to the first
    principles of human rights. They are questions that can have only one final solution,
    which may be so remote that fearful dangers will culminate in terrible disasters
    before the only remedy can do its work. There are now nearly eight millions of a
    Negro population, from four millions twenty years ago. There are more than two
    millions of mountain people in the South, one-half of whom cannot read. These
    benighted people live where there has never been a public-school system even for the
    more highly favored race, and where this more highly favored race deliberately
    assigns those who are not of its color to a permanent inferiority. The laws of caste
    are to be inflexibly enforced against all people of color who<a name="page304"
    id="page304"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 304]</span> would rise from their low-down
    conditions. This is our Southern mission field, which God has committed to us,
    according to our faith and opportunity.</p>
    <p>Those of our own race in the South could not do this work, which is upon our
    consciences and hearts, if they would. They do not see what we see. They would not if
    they could. They do not feel what we feel.</p>
    <p>We are sent, not as philanthropists who hear the cry of the poor and needy, nor as
    patriots who realize the perils that overhang the State, but as missionaries of Jesus
    Christ who believe that salvation takes in the whole man, including philanthropy and
    statesmanship, and whatever builds up man for time and for eternity.</p>
    <p>We have, however, no other charter for our work than that of missions. We have no
    other errand than that of the messengers of Christ. Only as we go in his name and
    with his spirit do we ask the churches to listen and hear with us, and with us to
    look and see.</p>
    <h4>OUR SCHOOLS.</h4>
    <p>Our missionary work has been largely in schools. It was God's providence. But
    these were always missionary centres.</p>
    <p>Their number at the present time is ninety-three; seventeen of these in the
    Southern States are Normal Schools from which a large proportion of the pupils go
    forth as teachers. It is computed that of the 15,000 Negro teachers in the South
    instructing 800,000 pupils, 13,500 became teachers from missionary schools, and that
    a great army of more than 7,000 of these teachers received their education in the
    institutions of the American Missionary Association. Thus the faith of the churches
    multiplies and accelerates itself.</p>
    <p>These Normal Schools are located in WILMINGTON, N.C., CHARLESTON and GREENWOOD,
    S.C., ATLANTA, MACON, SAVANNAH, THOMASVILLE and MCINTOSH, GA., MOBILE, ATHENS and
    MARION, ALA., MEMPHIS, JONESBORO, GRAND VIEW and PLEASANT HILL, TENN., LEXINGTON and
    WILLIAMSBURG, KY., to which must be added the large Normal and Industrial School at
    Santee Agency, Nebraska, the Oahe Industrial School and the Fort Berthold Industrial
    School, both in Dakota, and all three for the Indians, making altogether 20. The
    Association provides also the entire teaching force at the Ramona Indian School at
    Santa F&eacute;, New Mexico. To these Normal Schools, we may add the six normal
    departments in our colleges with their superior normal instruction. From nearly all
    of these, strong appeals for enlargement have come to meet the demands of a healthy
    growth. We have cut, trimmed and denied, with a resolution that has been painful both
    in the office and in the field, and yet the growth is upon us. Without pushing our
    work, it is pushing us.</p>
    <p>While ignorant millions need the truth and knowledge which we have, and there are
    resources in the hands of the disciples of Christ enough for <a name="page305"
    id="page305"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 305]</span> this vast and increasingly
    urgent work, the necessity of denying the provisions for the development of success
    becomes well-nigh oppressive.</p>
    <p>AT PLEASANT HILL, TENN., an important centre in our Mountain work, we have now, in
    addition to the new church, a school building unequalled in that region. A second
    building for a dormitory and boarding hall is nearly completed.</p>
    <p>THE GRAND VIEW ACADEMY in the Mountain region, has also increased its school
    accommodations, and the look forward is to a large institution with far-reaching
    influence in the valley of the Cumberland and on the plateau. If we are to hold this
    region, we must take possession now.</p>
    <p>We have also reassumed charge of a school at Beaufort, N.C. The people are already
    appealing to us in the accents of their own sacrifices for its immediate
    enlargement.</p>
    <p>Providentially, and without our solicitation, a generous giver, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
    who had already added to many large benevolences in the South, the fine building
    known as Ballard Hall and the excellent shops for industrial training at Tougaloo,
    made a proffer of $11,500 to erect at Macon, Ga., a school building of brick, capable
    of accommodating six hundred pupils. This successful school had grown until it had
    taken possession of the church building for school purposes. This noble gift,
    bestowed after a personal inspection on the part of Mr. Ballard, and upon personal
    conviction of its immediate necessity, could not be refused, and the substantial and
    spacious building, with its furnishings, is now nearly ready for occupancy. It will
    call for increased contributions from the churches.</p>
    <p>DORCHESTER ACADEMY, at McIntosh, Ga., is in a rice region remote from civilization
    and educational privileges, among thousands of Negro people very ignorant and poor.
    It cannot receive the pupils who beg for admission. Children are punctual at school
    from a distance of eight miles, lest they shall lose their privileges by tardiness or
    absence. Africa itself could scarcely send out a cry of greater need. We had decided
    to increase the capacity of this school, but are compelled to wait.</p>
    <p>AT GREENWOOD, S.C., the interests are so great and the appeals were so reasonable,
    that it was voted to enlarge the facilities for the growing institution; but at the
    last we could not do this, and the laborers there continue their prayers and their
    hopes.</p>
    <p>THE LINCOLN NORMAL INSTITUTE at Marion, Ala., was established in the year 1868, by
    the A.M.A. In the year 1874, the State of Alabama asked to assume the school, which
    had won a good name, and to increase its facilities for the education of the Negro.
    This was done. Last year, the work was deserted by the State and came anew into our
    hands. This, also, is an enlargement upon our schedule of work.</p>
    <p>At LEXINGTON, KY., our Normal School has grown to such a degree that even the
    vestibules and halls of our insufficient building were crowded with eager pupils.
    Teachers were teaching, and pupils were studying, in conditions <a name="page306"
    id="page306"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 306]</span> that none but missionary
    teachers would accept. For lack of room, industrial training has been impossible. The
    locality, meanwhile, has been surrounded by saloons, and houses that are worse. A
    benevolent lady who became acquainted with these facts offered $2,000 to purchase
    four acres of land for school and industrial purposes, and to give money sufficient
    for a new brick edifice with eight large school-rooms and all needful appointments
    and furnishings; the gift amounting to $15,000.</p>
    <p>We believe that we were not wrong in accepting this trust in your behalf, even
    though it means more teachers and increased expenditures. We are confident that your
    Christian faith would not decline this Christian benevolence. Hence the plans for
    Chandler School are in the hands of the builders. Could some like-minded wealthy
    steward of the grace of God visit Williamsburg, Ky., in our Mountain White work, we
    might be compelled to face another such dilemma.</p>
    <p>AT MERIDIAN, MISS., where Christian parents have besought us for years, past to
    open a missionary school, through which their children might be saved to morality and
    integrity of character during the formative periods of their lives, we have at last
    seen our way to answer their pathetic appeal in part. A day school with an industrial
    department is ready for the opening, the building having been constructed during the
    months of summer. For valuable aid in sympathy, counsel and influence in Meridian, we
    and the people to whom we are sent are greatly indebted to Rev. Wm. Hayne Leavell, of
    Meridian.</p>
    <p>WHITNEY HALL, for the Indian boys at Santee Agency, is another noble gift of large
    Christian faith for our Normal School in Nebraska. We summoned our courage to take
    this, also, with what the enlargement includes.</p>
    <p>These are the chief additions to our system of schools, though there have been
    less marked enlargements in other places. They are simply the growths of strong faith
    and strong life. They are the free and special gifts which came to us through the
    convictions of others who had realized the need.</p>
    <p>The common schools, 35 in number, in eight different Southern States, are in the
    hands of faithful teachers.</p>
    <p>There are six Chartered Institutions, behind which we have stood the year
    past.</p>
    <p>TALLADEGA COLLEGE in Talladega, Ala., has had a year of exceptional interest. The
    college work is developing and the theological school was never better. The
    industrial departments in agriculture and the mechanic arts offer fine advantages.
    The institution increases in popular favor and is full of students.</p>
    <p>ATLANTA UNIVERSITY in Georgia, under the temporary presidency of Prof. Francis,
    who was also college preacher and pastor, has moved on in its usual course. Through
    the successful solicitation of Prof. Bumstead, with our cordial and constant
    endorsement, sufficient Christian money came into <a name="page307"
    id="page307"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 307]</span> the treasury to meet the
    deficiency caused by the withdrawal of $8,000 from the State of Georgia. The
    Association was able in its grants to share in this satisfactory result. At the last
    meeting of the Trustees, Prof. Bumstead was elected President for the ensuing year,
    and Prof. Chase, in view of a removal to New Mexico, resigned the professorship which
    he had ably held many years.</p>
    <p>STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY at New Orleans, located in the most influential city of the
    Southwest, draws its students from refined Creole homes and from the rude cabins of
    the remote plantations. An interesting report gathered from twenty-two of its
    students who taught school during the summer vacation, tells us that they instructed
    1,398 pupils in day schools and organized thirteen Sunday-schools, in which were
    taught 1,574 children, most of whom were absolutely unreached before. This summer
    record of Straight University students is a partial illustration of what is going
    forth from it year by year; and not from Straight only, but from all of our higher
    schools. The theological work in Straight is of incalculable importance.</p>
    <p>TILLOTSON INSTITUTE, at Austin, Texas, has invigorated its normal course and has
    inaugurated a hopeful college preparatory department. The recipient of a special
    gift, it was enabled to complete a new industrial building, in which has begun a
    course of industrial training. It greatly needs a second dormitory hall for young
    women, and were not the institution so remote, some prophetic giver would see the
    urgency and the strategy of such a gift, and would make it. If, without the sight,
    some one shall be led to do this for Tillotson, he will reap the blessing of those
    who do not see and yet believe.</p>
    <p>TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY, near Jackson, Miss., is an institution of exceeding interest.
    It has a department of Biblical instruction added to its course of study, in which
    students are prepared to preach the gospel. Its industrial facilities are excellent,
    both for agricultural and mechanical training. The students can take the timber from
    the tree, and the iron in the rough, and make wagons and carriages sufficiently good
    to compete with the best makers in the State. The school in all of its parts is
    controlled by the missionary spirit. Rev. F.G. Woodworth, of Connecticut, last year
    assumed the Presidency.</p>
    <p>FISK UNIVERSITY, at Nashville, Tenn., is one of the oldest and most complete of
    all our Southern colleges, and has no superior among all the institutions in the
    country devoted to the education of the Negro. Giving relatively less attention to
    the industries, it models itself after our Northern colleges, and emulates them in
    the rigor of its intellectual studies and in the thoroughness with which it seeks to
    make good teachers and preachers; educators in the larger way for the race. It also
    has a department of theology. It has made its place, which it holds with enthusiasm
    and fidelity. If some one would give us, or leave us, money to endow this
    institution, he could scarcely send his influence further down the centuries than in
    this way. It would tell upon the race and upon the Nation.</p><p><a name="page308"
    id="page308"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 308]</span> In this glance at our schools,
    we see Christian schools. But they are more, they are missionary schools. We are
    bearing the torch of Christ into places of darkness. We teach the industries to them
    because they can be made tributary to the salvation of the people. They are the
    leaves of the tree of life, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the
    people.</p>
    <p>We may not close this review of our school system without remembering those
    institutions now standing alone; great Hampton, in whose rich gifts we rejoice, and
    Berea, another child of the A.M.A., now grown to strength.</p>
    <p>TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY, at Washington, also, we extend the sympathy of a common
    purpose, together with such financial aid as we may for the support of its
    theological course.</p>
    <p>We point to these great institutions which have been planted and fostered by the
    A.M.A., together with those which are still upheld by us, with a feeling akin to that
    of the renowned Cornelia when she said, "Behold my jewels."</p>

    <h4>CHURCH WORK.</h4>
    <p>We turn now to our Church Work.</p>
    <p>In every school we have an incipient church; in many of these are organized
    churches. From all of them there is a continual going forth of a predisposition
    towards Congregational Churches, which will make for churches in the future.</p>

    <p>Four new Churches have been organized during the year. These are at Decatur, Ala.,
    Crossville, Deer Lodge and Pine Mountain, Tenn. A fine church edifice has also been
    erected in Ironaton, Ala., which is soon to be dedicated. The members have sacrificed
    nobly to secure it. The <a name="page309" id="page309"></a><span class="newpage">[pg
    309]</span> church at Meridian has united with the Association in the erection of a
    beautiful house of worship which, with the new school and the teachers' home, will be
    ready in a few weeks for occupancy. The church at Knoxville has been enlarged and is
    practically new. It will soon be re-dedicated. The church at Pine Mountain is a year
    old; is already the center of four Sunday-schools, with an attendance of 415
    children, only 10 of whom had ever been in a Sunday-school before.</p>
    <p>Revivals of religious interest have been reported from our churches in Washington,
    Wilmington, Charleston, Talladega, Mobile, Athens, Marion, Selma, Birmingham and New
    Orleans. Those of the churches which are side by side with our educational
    institutions are most hopeful; but wherever we have planted churches, they stand
    forth to represent the ethics of Christianity, the purity and truth of character
    which must be contained in a worthy discipleship. A large proportion of our pastors
    are children of the A.M.A. Parsonages have been built for our churches in Mobile,
    Ala., and in Dallas, Texas.</p>
    <h4>MOUNTAIN WORK.</h4>
    <p>This year has laid great emphasis on the fact that we have entered, in the
    Southern mountains, a missionary field of vast importance, pressing needs and
    unbounded hopefulness. We have in this region, where a few years ago there was
    nothing, two normal schools, two academies, five common schools, and twenty
    churches.</p>
    <p>In a territory five hundred miles long, and more than two hundred miles
    broad&mdash;twice the size of all New England&mdash;are at least between three and
    four hundred counties with a population greater than that of Maine, New Hampshire,
    Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut combined, without schools worthy of the name,
    without Sunday-schools, without prayer meetings, without an educated, spiritual, or
    even moral ministry, without a weekly Sabbath religious service of any kind, or any
    of the institutions of the gospel which really elevate them. They have a religion
    which is not a pure Christianity and which does not even involve morality.</p>
    <p>The Christian work, lately introduced and already done among them, demonstrates
    that they are capable of a rapid and radical change, when once the vivifying touch of
    the gospel has reached their hearts.</p>
    <p>Instead of twenty Congregational churches among them, there is room for a
    thousand, and instead of nine Christian schools, if there were twenty-five normal
    schools, it would be only one to each hundred thousand people; and if there were a
    hundred common schools, there would be one to each three or four counties for models.
    There should be one good college. If there were Congregational churches in this
    region in the same proportion as in New England there would be a full thousand. If
    they were in the same proportion as Connecticut, there would be twelve hundred
    churches; as New Hampshire, thirteen hundred; as Vermont, sixteen hundred.</p>
    <a name="page310" id="page310"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 310]</span>
    <p>Congregationalism goes to these people as the representative of pure, intelligent
    and progressive Christianity. We can gather them into schools, Sunday-schools and
    churches, anywhere where we can put a Christian worker. Our only limit is consecrated
    workers and the support for them. The field is as ripe this very day for a thousand
    as for a score. But the school and the church must go together.</p>
    <p>This is one of the richest of the mineral regions of the world. Great forests of
    black walnut, poplar, and other valuable timber, are awaiting the woodman's ax and
    the lumberman's mill. Railroads are either built, building or planned for every part
    to carry away its wonderful natural resources. The people are poor, but the land is
    rich, and a few years hence will see wealth in the place of poverty, in the hands of
    either the natives, or those who will have displaced them. All the motives which urge
    the establishment of the church and the school for the incoming population of the
    West, press us to build them in this great empire of the South; and they become
    doubly imperative when we take into account the fact that a population of between two
    and three millions is already in the land and needs to be saved now. The motives for
    home and foreign missions are thus combined, and impelling us for Christ's sake, for
    humanity's sake, and for our country's sake, to give the gospel to this people.</p>
    <p>We are not building pauper institutions in this mountain country to be forever a
    dead weight for the Northern churches to carry, but institutions which will very
    speedily take care of themselves, and give to others as they have received.</p>
    <p>This is a portion of the South where slavery scarcely existed. When war came, it
    was loyal to the Union almost to a man. This fact shows that they have a natural
    affiliation with "Northern ideas." The caste spirit is among them&mdash;as it is
    indeed in the North to some extent&mdash;but it much more readily yields to reason
    and loving teaching than in other portions of the South. Vigorous and extensive
    missionary work can and will mould the ideas and sentiments of this whole region, and
    thus establish no-caste churches and schools, where they would demonstrate to the
    South that they do not carry with them social disorder and every baleful
    influence.</p>
    <p>Amid the success, joy and hopefulness of the year's work, came the affliction of
    the shooting of Prof. George Lawrence, while about his duties in our school in
    Jellico, Tenn. It was the work of a miserable creature whose brain was fired with
    whiskey, and who was urged on by the saloon element as a retaliation for earnest
    temperance work. After long and anxious weeks of intense suffering, a brave fight
    against death proved successful, and we now hope that our missionary's life is spared
    for many years of usefulness. Nearly a hundred men have been shot already in this one
    place, and the place itself is not more than six years old. Is it strange that these
    mountain people who have a glimpse of better things, are appealing to us every week
    of the year to plant institutions among them? <a name="page311"
    id="page311"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 311]</span> Is it not the voice of Christ
    clearly commanding us to possess and subdue this land, and to transform it into a
    part of his peaceful and beneficent Kingdom, which shall join hands with us to pass
    on the torch of Christ to others yet in darkness?</p>
    <h4>THE INDIANS.</h4>
    <p>The people of America are determined to press the Indian problem to a speedy
    solution. Provision has been made for giving lands in severalty, and the next great
    movement should be to induce the Government to provide secular education, and the
    churches to furnish religious instruction to all the Indians. The American Missionary
    Association, during the year, has responded to this new impulse by enlarging its
    work&mdash;in the opening of new stations, in the erection of new buildings, and in
    the appointment of more missionaries and teachers.</p>
    <p>At the Santee Agency, Nebraska, our oldest mission station and school has had
    marked prosperity in its normal, theological and industrial departments, and, better
    than all, in a deep and wide-spread religious interest that has pervaded the school
    and the church. The new building, named Whitney Hall&mdash;from its giver&mdash;has
    been erected, affording accommodations for twenty-two of the larger and more advanced
    pupils, and furnishing rooms for the treasurer's family. A liberal gift from Mrs.
    Henry Perkins, of Hartford, Conn., provides, for the present at least, for the
    running expenses of the Boys' Hall, and, in appreciation of the gift, and of the
    interest in the school which the gift implies, the building will hereafter be called
    Perkins Hall.</p>
    <p>At Oahe, Dakota, on the beautiful Peoria Bottom, both the school and church have
    prospered. The school is crowded to its utmost capacity and a greater number of
    pupils has been granted in the contract with the Government. A new building is
    urgently called for. The closing exercises of the school were attended by a
    picturesque group of three or four hundred Indians, who were encamped around the
    station. Some of these came a hundred and twenty-five miles to attend the
    exercises.</p>
    <p>One marked feature in the enlargement of the work has been the opening of two more
    Central Stations: one at Rosebud Agency, the other located at Fort Yates, near the
    junction of the Grand River with the Missouri. The new mission house has been built,
    and by the aid of special gifts from benevolent friends at the East, a commodious
    building has been erected for a hospital.</p>
    <p>A peculiar and very interesting feature of our Indian work is the out-stations,
    located remote from the Central Stations. These stations, numbering twenty-one, have
    been hindered and also enlarged during the past year. The hindrance came from the
    interference of the Government. In its well-intended zeal for the introduction of the
    English language, it surpassed the limits which experience had fixed, by requiring
    that the vernacular should <a name="page312" id="page312"></a><span
    class="newpage">[pg 312]</span> not be taught, nor even spoken, in any Indian schools
    on the Reservation including these mission stations, which were wholly sustained by
    benevolent funds. Under this ruling, thirteen stations were closed from September to
    January. But the remonstrances coming from almost every denomination of Christians in
    the land induced the Government to modify its orders, and the schools have all been
    re-opened.</p>
    <p>Some new buildings have been erected on this part of the field&mdash;a new house
    for dwelling and school on the Grand River, and a cheap structure at the Cheyenne
    River Agency, in which religious services are held at the times for the disbursement
    of the rations, when large numbers of the Indians assemble and remain for many days.
    A new impulse has been given to this out-station work by contributions received at
    one of the missionary meetings in Northfield, Mass. Four new stations were provided
    for at that time by the contribution of $400 for a building at each station, and $300
    for the support of the teacher. One was the gift of Mr. Moody, another of Mr. Sankey,
    whose names these two stations will bear.</p>
    <p>Fort Berthold, in the northern part of Dakota, has authorization from the
    Government for a larger number of pupils under contract than last year. But our
    exigencies require for this only a few and inexpensive repairs and additions to be
    made on the buildings.</p>
    <p>The Skokomish mission continues its stable progress. The missionary, Rev. Myron
    Eells, has been tempted during the past year by several calls to enter more lucrative
    fields of service, but his attachment to the work, begun by his most honored father,
    and continued by himself, is so great that he prefers to remain with his people, and
    to aid them in their progress in civil and Christian life.</p>
    <p>The Indian school at Santa F&eacute;, New Mexico, has had some changes, but the
    arrangement between the Association and the trustees is continued, and the school,
    under the charge of Prof. Elmore Chase, maintains its useful service in the training
    of the children of the Apaches, one of the most hopeful and promising tribes of
    Indians on the continent.</p>
    <h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>
    <p>The special interest of the year centres in the evangelistic work that was
    commenced early in the winter. Of our 39 workers reported, fourteen are Chinamen, who
    have been converted in our schools. Two of these brethren were set apart last
    December as special evangelists, one going to our missions in Southern California,
    and the other to our more Northern missions. Subsequently another one entered the
    field. The intention was to give one month of service at each mission, and the
    gratifying experience has been that at no point has this one month been deemed
    sufficient. At the end of five months the harvest reported was forty souls brought to
    repentance.</p>
    <p>Three new missions are upon our list this year; those at Los Angeles, San
    Buenaventura, and Tucson. At Los Angeles no less than 75 pupils <a name="page313"
    id="page313"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 313]</span> were enrolled the first month,
    and at all these places Christian Associations have been formed.</p>
    <p>A minister on the Pacific Coast not in connection with our schools, after giving a
    sketch of work accomplished which could not be tabulated, says: "Socially,
    intellectually, spiritually, the Chinese mission school does its beneficent work. But
    everything is made but the means to the spiritual end. The whole drift of the
    teaching, the songs, the pictures, the Scripture text, is to make known Christ. Every
    evening's lesson ends with worship. In no year, may I add, have there been so many
    conversions among the Chinese on this coast as in the one just passed."</p>
    <h4>WOMAN'S BUREAU.</h4>
    <p>There are thirteen Woman's State Organizations which co-operate with us in our
    missionary work. These are in Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, Alabama, Ohio,
    Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota. Other
    States, also, not yet organized, are assisting in definite lines, as Massachusetts
    and New Hampshire. Our Bureau of Woman's Work has for many years proved its wisdom.
    The state of black womanhood and girlhood taken together is pitiful. The permanent
    and uplifting Christianization and civilization to be engrafted on the Negro race in
    this land, can come only as the womanhood of that people is imbued with right
    principles and led to right practices. Unless the life of the woman is reached and
    saved, there can be no true religion, family life, or social status. Hence our
    industrial and boarding schools for the training of girls in domestic work, in the
    trades of dressmaking and such like, in the art of cooking, the cultivation of small
    fruits and flowers, so that the sacred influences of Christianity shall circle around
    the thousand firesides where now everything is coarse, and ignorant, and senseless.
    With our large corps of lady teachers, the Woman's Bureau, as an intermediary between
    the Woman's State Association and their sisters who are teaching in the field, and
    the women and girls to whom they are sent, has proved during the year its increasing
    efficiency.</p>
    <h4>FINANCES</h4>
    <p>The receipts have been, $320,953.42, which with the balance on hand, September
    30th, 1887, of $2,193.80, makes a total of $323,147.22. We have received in addition
    to this $1,000 for an Endowment Fund. The total disbursements for the year have been
    $328,788.43. The churches through the National Council have asked us to keep abreast
    with the providence of God. "It is our duty," said the Ohio State Association, "to
    see that this great work in which we have borne so large and honorable a part, halt
    not, nor slacken in its energy because of our failure to keep its treasury
    replenished and its faithful laborers re-enforced and supported by our gifts and our
    prayers."</p>
    <a name="page314" id="page314"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 314]</span>
    <p>Said our good friend, the <i>Congregationalist</i>, in an editorial after our
    inspiring meeting at Portland in October last: "Never did the magnitude of the field,
    and the complex character of its labors, appear in such startling lines. Either of
    the four departments of labor demands the money and the force which is distributed
    among all. But, in the providence of God, this society is called upon to prosecute
    this fourfold work. It cannot abandon a single field and must not be asked to. It can
    do in the next five years a work for Christianity and for Congregationalism in the
    South and West which will tell on the coming century. As Christians, and as
    Congregational Christians, we must see to it that it be not obliged to pinch its
    workers and to turn away from promising openings in order to keep free from debt the
    coming year."</p>
    <p>Thus charged, we have yet gone within our instructions. We have made every dollar
    do more than its work. We have gathered up the fragments that nothing be lost; and
    yet to-day our payments anticipate our receipts by the sum of $5,641.21. We do not
    regret the anxiety and pain which it has cost us to effect what we have. The generous
    words of sympathy and confidence that have come to us of late, with noble gifts,
    large and small, repay the solicitude and incessant care. We thank God and his
    people, and hold firmly our faith in Him who said, "Knock, and it shall be opened
    unto you." He opened the door. Our faith is in Him who also said, "Ask, and ye shall
    receive."</p>
    <hr class="short" />
    <p>The year opened with the Association bereft of its honored President. We come to
    this new year happy in our choice of the Rev. Wm. M. Taylor, D.D., of New York, to
    fill this most important position. In his acceptance we congratulate the
    Association.</p>
    <p>Since the year began, the churches have missed the stirring appeals of our beloved
    Secretary Powell, who had the especial oversight and burden of the collecting fields.
    Such a life as that of James Powell is not common. It was a grand sacrifice of
    undeviating love for those whose poverty made him a debtor to them. His consecration
    will not be forgotten.</p>
    <p>His sudden departure&mdash;our great bereavement&mdash;made necessary the transfer
    of the Rev. C.J. Ryder from the field to the District Secretaryship of the Eastern
    District in New England, who has brought with his energy and zeal such an experience,
    and personal knowledge of the entire field, as to insure him the most hearty welcome
    and co-operation on the part of our pastors and churches.</p>
    <p>The Rev. F.E. Jenkins, a graduate of Williams College and of Hartford Theological
    Seminary, for some time earnestly engaged in our Southern work, has been appointed a
    field superintendent for personal examination and supervision of our churches and
    schools, and has already entered upon his duties.</p>
    <p>The Association, with its Superintendents continually in the field, who <a
    name="page315" id="page315"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 315]</span> report every
    fact to the Secretaries at the office, who in turn submit the entire work to the
    churches, is thus continually made better prepared to direct the sacrifices of the
    benevolent in ways that shall not be irresponsible or unwise, than those which are
    subject to no such scrutiny or supervision, and are held to no responsibility. Much
    less money would be diverted from this authorized and recognized servant of the
    Congregational Churches, and far greater efficiency would be secured, if our friends
    would remember that their own ordained agency can open as many missions as they will
    make possible, which shall have, at least, one advantage over independent and
    unsupervised work, in that, through us, they shall be under your own constant
    Christian watch and care.</p>
    <p>We may not close this review of our year's work and attendant suggestions without
    remembrance of our indebtedness to the American Bible Society, for its grant of
    Bibles; to the Congregational Sunday-school and Publishing Society for the help given
    to our struggling churches and Sunday-schools in its grant of books and lesson helps.
    We rejoice in the unity of our societies, which make all one in the blending of the
    parts for the great common purpose of redeeming the lost and gathering them into the
    family of Christ.</p>

    <h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Struggles In The "Lone Star State."</h3>
    <center>
      BY A.C. GARROTT.
    </center>
    <p>My home, Marion, Ala., was also the location of the Lincoln Normal Institute, and
    fortunately I had attended that school for several years. Being next to the oldest of
    eight children, my parents decided to take me from school in '83, that I might earn
    something. I had often heard of Talladega College, and wanted very much to enter
    there, but my father being only a poor carpenter, it was impossible for me to get the
    means to accomplish my desires.</p>
    <p>However, by the aid of Northern friends I entered the above named school, October
    2d, 1883. Evenings and Saturdays I worked by the hour to help defray my expenses.
    Unable to obtain a school, I could be found at the college, during the summers of '84
    and '85, working about the buildings or on the farm. The money earned there was used
    for schooling. During my last year in school I had job work&mdash;sweeping and caring
    for lamps. This work was done early in order that I might have time for study. And
    each morning, before day, my broom could be heard moving through the corridors. At
    the close of school, I had paid by work, and a prize gained in speaking the year
    before, about $52.75. It was agreed that the balance should be paid after leaving
    school. In a class of ten I received a diploma from the <a name="page316"
    id="page316"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 316]</span> normal department, June 17,
    1886. My time during the summer was occupied in working with my father at the
    carpenter's trade.</p>
    <p>Texas was said to have good public-schools, and it was my plan to try the "Lone
    Star State." I was working to secure means to pay the fare, but father failed in
    being paid promptly, and this forced me to borrow money for the purpose. Many tried
    to discourage me in my plan as it was what is sometimes termed as a "wild goose
    chase." I remarked, though, that if no schools could be found, there were other
    things to be done&mdash;cotton to be picked; wagons to be driven; and ditches to be
    dug. So the work-clothes were not forgotten when my trunk was packed.</p>
    <p>On September 30, 1886, I arrived in Henderson, a stranger to all save one, and
    with a very small purse. Then commenced my trials. I was in my twenty-first year, but
    had a young appearance, and the trustees of most schools objected to me for that
    reason. I walked many miles in search of work, and it was not till the middle of
    November that my first school opened.</p>
    <p>Owing money for schooling, for fare to this State, and for board after coming
    here, caused me to start far below the surface in pecuniary matters. As I had made
    large plans, that was quite discouraging.</p>
    <p>The school proceeded nicely and a Sabbath-school was organized in connection. The
    latter was quite small, though there was a large attendance in the day school. At the
    close of school, March 23, 1887, all expressed a willingness for me to teach the next
    session, but there was a trouble ahead which changed their views. The question of
    prohibition was to be decided by the people in August. I am sorry to say the majority
    of our people were on the wrong side. But most of the teachers and preachers fought
    with an untiring energy against the saloons. For this act of ours, many refused to
    give us work. Some even sneered at the "prohib. teachers," as we walked along the
    streets. Those were days of discouragement as our labor seemed to be in vain.</p>
    <p>My summer's work lasted only a month, and being an independent school the returns
    were quite small, $6.00 only. Having to aid my parents, and a two months' sickness,
    caused me to be below the surface again at the opening of my school, November 14.
    This work continued for six months. A Sabbath-school was organized; and, unlike the
    previous year, outnumbered the daily attendance.</p>
    <p>It has been said that it is better to turn up something than to wait for something
    to turn up. So I bought a small outfit for making photographs. It is incomplete, but
    enough to get an idea of the art. After looking at some of my work, our county Judge
    was heard to say. "That's a good picture for that nigger." My summer school was nine
    miles away, and I came here every Friday evening, that I might practice at my new
    trade. To save the hire and feed of a horse, I always walked here and back. The way
    at times seems dark, but I take courage from the fact that roads to success must lead
    through hardships.</p>

    <h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Review Of The Year.</h3>
    <center>
      BY REV. W.C. POND, D.D.
    </center>
    <p>The fiscal year of our missions closed Aug. 31. I desire to set before the readers
    of the MISSIONARY a statement of the year's work, made as complete as the space at my
    command allows:</p>
    <p>1. <i>Seventeen</i> missions have been sustained during a part or the whole of the
    year. Ten of these have had no intermission whatever, except for a day or two at the
    holidays, and in one instance a fortnight's vacation. Of the remaining seven, three
    are new missions, viz: Los Angeles, San Buenaventura and Tucson. The work at these
    points is full of interest and hope, and has indeed already begun to yield what seem
    to us saving results.</p>
    <p>2. <i>Thirty-nine</i> workers have been engaged. Of these, fourteen are Chinese
    brethren, converted in connection with our missions, and trained to the work in the
    work itself. The aggregate number of months of service is 295.</p>
    <p>3. In comparison with the record of the previous year, but little change can be
    noted. The total number enrolled is 1,131, being larger by 87, but on the whole one
    record is about the equivalent of the other. Indeed, it seems to me that in both
    years we reached very near to the <i>outmost limit</i> of what is possible with the
    means at our command. The special interest of this year's history centers in the
    attempt to do, and to learn better <i>how</i> to do, evangelistic work. Three of our
    brethren have been set apart to this, and have been followed from place to place by
    the prayers of many. They had much to learn when they started forth and have much yet
    to learn. It is by no means clear to me that we have hit upon the wisest methods, and
    I know that we have not yet entered into the fullness of power, either with God or
    man. Yet I can see that these brethren are stronger and braver and more eager in this
    work than they were a year ago. And the blessing of God on their labors has been such
    as enables us to believe that full sixty of their countrymen have been led to Christ.
    This carries the whole number concerning whom this hope has been cherished, since the
    beginning of our work, above 700.</p>
    <p>4. THE FINANCES. Our expenditures have been: For salaries of workers, $6,403.00;
    for rents of mission houses, $2,066.00; for incidental expenses, $1,150.15; total,
    $9,619.75. Our resources have been: From the parent society, $6,100; balance from
    previous year, $45.50; offerings made through the treasury of this auxiliary,
    $2,590.80; total, $8,736.30. This leaves a deficit of $882.85, a part of which can be
    met from our Permanent Property Account, but fully $500.00 needs yet to be secured if
    we are to <a name="page318" id="page318"></a><span class="newpage">[pg 318]</span>
    provide things honest in the sight of all men. Thus far in the history of our
    mission, the account of no year has closed with the blot of a deficit upon it. The
    account of the year just ended is held open for awhile in the hope that the good
    precedent of the past may be still maintained. And, oh, if we might be a little less
    hampered by poverty;&mdash;if we might be set free to enter opened doors, and to make
    the most possible of our opportunities, how great would be the privilege and joy of
    showing in blessed experiment that the truest economy is a wise and careful
    generosity.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
